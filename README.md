# GGS VISUALISER

hullooo, this is a ggst visualiser, it uses the ggst ingame icons completely without consent and completely without affiliation with arcsys, if they ask for this to be taken down it'll get taken down, this software is not in competition with anything arcsys make so, it should be fine however.

## How to use

you need python installed, and to pip install tkinter and pynput

after that shrimply launch the software

if you want to change your controls you can do that from line 65, this software doesn't work with joysticks but could be modified to use them if you wanted, however i think you'd do better to just us bongo cat or something as this is really just a silly edit for us cool cat keyboard users

## warranty

none, there's no warranty, if this breaks your computer fucking rip i have nothing to do with it, in fact, DONT use this software, please.

## socials

you can find all my socials from my main user page, but if you're interested i write software like this a lot on stream, [at twitch.tv/ctrlaltcookie](https://www.twitch.tv/ctrlaltcookie) leaving me a prime subby would help a lot ðŸ¥º
